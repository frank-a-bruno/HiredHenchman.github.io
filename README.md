## Welcome to my Works on File

Professionally, I am a Gen-X > 20-year technology journeyman who has led dozens of highly technical and profitable deals.  My purpose driven work can be leveraged for your inspiration. I never created anything with the intent of keeping it on my hard drive. Using my Works on File can help you get deals done faster. 

Technology acquisition risk management via Intellectual Property management is my area of Expertise, specializing in compliance services, contingency planning, technology escrow, verification testing, DR testing and technology sunsetting (asset management), as well as application development tools, content repositories, metadata management/triggered workflow, microservices integration, migration, content distribution, digital rights management and digital preservation.
 
As a pre-requisite to any deal signing, there should always be a Contingency Plan to address the unknowns and to instill trust in support of budgets and funding. You should have a fool proof back up plan that is tested frequently and will protect any investment with a Developer. 

My services include administering to underlying contractual obligations that require compliance checking and DR/BC testing, helping to establish a baseline of requirements for recovery, specify deposit materials as required to enable failover, data recovery, migration and business continuity in the event of a declared disaster or material breach of contract or sudden cessation of business. 

This risk exists with all Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers (remember Nirvanix?), Platform-as-a-Service Providers, Software-as-a-Service Providers or other Managed Service Providers that are hired to perform a service, but are unable for whatever reason. Identifying the potential risk will also help determine the triggering conditions to set your Contingency Plan in motion.  

Work with someone who knows how to create partnerships with System Integrators, Value Added Resellers, Platform-as-a-Service Providers, OEM ISV's and other Managed Service Providers to use Contingency Plans as a part of their Product Management/Product Marketing strategy. Use the Contingency Plan to instill trust and overcome the risk objection to doing business with small unknown risky Developers. 

Let me create and administer to your Contingency Plans

Personally, I am no coder! I know business process, I know UI/UX, I know Risk, but don't intimidate me with HTML.

I am also a dad to a five year old, ten year old, sixteen year old, twenty-three year old and a twenty-five year old.  I know how to nurture and negotiate reasonably.

### Are you a Developer looking for funding or trying to close a deal?

If you are a Developer trying to close a deal, then having a fully baked, purpose driven contingency plan for your customers should instill trust. You need trust and a fully documented DR/BC plan that includes unfettered access to their data.

### Are you a Technology User looking for budget or trying to close a deal?

If you are a Technology User trying to close a deal, then having a fully baked, purpose driven contingency plan for your risk managers and finance stakeholders should instill trust. You need trust and a fully documented DR/BC plan that includes unfettered access to your data.
